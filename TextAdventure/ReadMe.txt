    CONSOLE APPLICATION : TextAdventure Project Overview
========================================================================

Overview

Text-Adventure games were popular in the last century, and out of the curiosity and advice of my friend I have decided to make one of my own. I have took this as my summer project which will help me learn a couple of new things about programming, the language C++ and also help me stay in shape for the following semester. This is also the first "big project" and the first project I am sharing on the git.

*************** FILES OVERVIEW **************
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

TextAdventure.vcxproj
    This is the main project file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard.
    It contains information about the version of Visual C++ that generated the file, and
    information about the platforms, configurations, and project features selected with the
    Application Wizard.

TextAdventure.vcxproj.filters
    This is the filters file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard. 
    It contains information about the association between the files in your project 
    and the filters. This association is used in the IDE to show grouping of files with
    similar extensions under a specific node (for e.g. ".cpp" files are associated with the
    "Source Files" filter).

TextAdventure.cpp
    This is the main application source file.
    
Gameplay.h
    Header file of the class called "Gameplay".
    
Gameplay.cpp
    Cpp file of the class called "Gameplay".

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Other standard files:

StdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp
    These files are used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file
    named TextAdventure.pch and a precompiled types file named StdAfx.obj.

Other notes:

Up to this date this is still an unfinished project. This means that the game itself will always function but the functionallity of this game will be limited until stated otherwise. Not all files are stated above in the "FILES OVERVIEW" simply because that there could be a few changes which would have for a result for a files to be overwritten or deleted. Only the files that are "here to stay" will be in the "FILES OVERVIEW" until the completition of this project. When completed, this project will have all the files descriptions in the "FILES OVERVIEW" section.
